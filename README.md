# MMSS

Python Implementation for the MMSS System: Storytelling Simulation for Decision-Making Support to Mitigate Misinformation on Social Media

# Visualization

An example of COVID-19 social network mitigation story (Green nodes: true info, Red nodes: Misinformation) created by MMSS. The visualization is based on the Gephi (https://gephi.org/) software while the visualization temporal meta-data is generated by the paper proposed coloring graph algorithm..

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code on default parameters on covid-19- 100 users
1- Unzip the data.zip file first before running the code.

2- execute 'python main.py' on terminal or run the script from an IDE.

3- after execution, to visualize results, run the Gephi software on the generated temporal meta-data in the graphs folder.
